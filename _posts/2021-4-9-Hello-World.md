# `fun hello() = world()`

My name is Prannaya Gupta, and I am a student in NUS High School. I am currently in my 4th year, and I am majoring in Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and Chemistry and studying compulsory English Language and Hindi Language modules. I am also taking optional Physics Olympiad and Chemistry Olympiad Training modules.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an Hindi Exam tomorrow. Goodbye, fellow human.
